# CEIR
This project is for the SPIE paper - Novel Receipt Recognition with Deep Learning Algorithms.
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end novel receipt recognition system for capturing effective information from receipts (CEIR).

CEIR system demo is available at:
[CEIR Demo](http://eadst.com/ceir)

The CEIR has three parts: preprocess, detection, recognition.
